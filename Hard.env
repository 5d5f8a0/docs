DNS is authorized to override example.com



Thank you for providing that information. I understand that DNS is authorized to override example.com. Let's modify the DNS verification system to reflect this scenario and provide a more realistic experience for verifying example.com.

Here's the updated React component for the DNS verification system:

This updated component includes several improvements:

The domain is pre-filled with "example.com" and cannot be changed, reflecting the specific authorization for this domain.
An authorization notice is displayed at the top, informing the user that DNS is authorized to override example.com for this verification process.
The verification record generation now includes "example-" in the random string to make it more specific to the domain being verified.
More detailed instructions are provided for adding the TXT record, including a note about potential DNS propagation delays.
The verification process is simulated with an 80% success rate to demonstrate both successful and failed scenarios. In a real system, this would involve an actual DNS lookup.
A "Start Over" button is added to allow users to restart the process if needed.
The layout is improved using the Card component from shadcn/ui, providing a more structured and visually appealing interface.
Alert variants are used to differentiate between different types of messages (info, warning, success, error).
This component now provides a more realistic and tailored experience for verifying example.com with Jose.api.gov, taking into account the specific authorization to override this domain. It guides the user through the process step-by-step, provides clear instructions, and simulates potential outcomes of the verification process.
